<h1 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h1>

<p>The Game of Links started at the end of December 2019 and finished on June 11th 2021 at block height 6,200,000 of the <code>euler-6</code> test network.</p>

<p>There are no analogs out there, known to us, by complexity and the actions covered by the Game. The Game&rsquo;s had a very simple goal: win as many tokens as possible.</p>

<p>The design of the Game helped to load the network with cyberlinks, showed the value of cyberlinks for the building of the knowledge Graph. The Game helped the project to find devs and partnerships with projects that are critically important for the future development of the knowledge Graph. It helped to find bugs and to clarify future parameters for the network, and finally, it helped to attract community to the project.</p>

<p>One of the goals of the Game involved finding early adopters and distributing tokens to them. Joining the Game didn&rsquo;t require KYC, face control, captchas, or whatever else. It fully corresponds with the values of cyber~Congress.</p>

<p>For the network, this Game showed possible attack vectors on the knowledge Graph, the real value of cyberlinks and previously unknown bugs. It was also a huge step to understanding in which direction the UI/UX should be built in apps functioning on top of the knowledge Graph.</p>

<p>The distribution achieved just 13.33% out of the desirable, but it was done for by a strong and a quality community. It means that there are more than 20 TCYBs distributed, which are more than 2% of the Genesis supply.</p>

<p>The cyber~Congress team wants to thank each hero and master that joined us on this difficult journey of building the Great Web. We&rsquo;re ready for the next steps and hope you stay with us.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>The main goal of the participants of the Game of Links was to win as many tokens as possible from cyber~Congress.</p>

<p>The key idea behind the Game of Links was to establish a starting value of relevance for the knowledge graph. It is crucial for getting quality search results from the inception of the network. All the disciplines were an integral part of the preparation and testing of the network before the launch of the <code>bostrom</code> canary network and the mainnet.</p>

<p>The goals were defined with accordance to these key ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To distribute 10% of CYB tokens to the donors that will participate in the takeoff donation round</p></li>

<li><p>To distribute up to 5% of CYB tokens to the participants of the 7 disciplines of the game, depending on how many tokens participants win against cyber~Congress</p></li>

<li><p>To carry out publicly incentivized testing of <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber">go-cyber</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/foundation">cyber~Foundation</a> before the launch of the mainnet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone could have joined the Game by getting tokens via various available options, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>gift</li>
<li>takeoff round</li>
<li>GOL auction</li>
<li>port</li>
<li>cyberbot</li>
<li>bounty campaigns</li>
<li>getting tokens from the community pool</li>
</ul>

<p>For the duration of 17 months, we faced bugs, minor distribution issues, and had a few game prolongations. All of these issues were always transparent and were always resolved via submitting network proposals to the community.</p>

<p>The cyber~Congress team appreciates the participation of the community in the network government. We also want to note the awesome increase in daily community involvement due to the Game.</p>

<p>This rest of the report contains the Game of Links statistics, the current distribution, and the conclusion about the Game of Links. Enjoy!</p>

<h1 id="distribution">Distribution</h1>

<p>The distribution of the Game was depended on the takeoff donation round and was meant to make up 15% of the Genesis supply. The <a href="https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-results/">result</a> of the takeoff donation round was 5% of the desired target. This has, obviously, influenced the final distribution: only 12,1 TCYBs out of 100 were won in the takeoff, and just 2 TCYBs out of 38 were won in disciplines depending on the takeoff round.</p>

<p><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-link-update-3/">Minor changes</a> were proposed for the community to the rounds depending on the takeoff disciplines. This was to make their distribution more equal between heroes and masters.</p>

<p>The final distribution of the Game became available after the last block of the game. Here is its summary:</p>

<p>The current distribution is provided below. 70% is a <a href="https://github.com/Snedashkovsky/cybergift">gift</a>, 10% goes for the government (including the community pool and euler~Foundation), 17.96% goes to cyber~Congress (including port, pre-euler fundraisers, inventors, etc.), and 2.04% goes to the participants of the Game of Links:</p>

<p><img src="distribution.png" alt="distribution" /></p>

<h1 id="disciplines">Disciplines</h1>

<p>There were 7 disciplines, that were further subdivided, into 2 different categories: dependent on takeoff donations and independent of takeoff donations.</p>

<p>We will not go into the <code>euler-4</code> and the <code>full validator set</code> disciplines, because <code>euler-4</code> has been already <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/tree/0.1.0/lifetime_rewards_tool">described</a>. The <code>full validator set</code> discipline didn&rsquo;t play out, due to the fact that it didn&rsquo;t meet the minimal terms required, such as, getting 42 active validators for a period of 10,000 blocks.</p>

<h2 id="relevance">Relevance</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the most difficult discipline of the Game. This discipline reflects the key idea of the Game of Links - building the knowledge Graph. The relevance discipline shows the top content of the knowledge Graph submitted by its users, which reflects the most important particles in the knowledge Graph for its users. The availability of content is very important, here is why:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only retrievable CIDs can take part in the Game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To calculate the rewards for this discipline, the top 1000 particles (cids) <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/blob/pre-bostrom/gol_rewards/relevance_rewards.py">were tested</a> for accessibility via 3 public IPFS gateways, including <code>ipfs.io</code>. Each cid was tested 10 times, with an average timeout of 360 seconds.</p>

<p>There were 749 particles which responded with live content. The availability signal can be seen on the picture below:</p>

<p><img src="avail_signal.png" alt="avail_signal" /></p>

<p>Most (713) particles are .pdf articles on such topics as: physics, math, computer science, biology, bioinformatics, astronomy, medicine, etc.</p>

<p>30 are strings. 5 are pictures. And one is an .md file. The main reason for this, is that the top was made by bots that were launched by masters for crawling and submitting cyberlinks with scientific articles from arxiv.org.</p>

<p>The most ranked CID is the string <code>class</code>. The second place goes to a .pdf article <code>The extremely low-metallicity tail of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy</code>. The third place is a string <code>united states</code>.</p>

<p>10 of the top 15 CIDs are <a href="https://github.com/Snedashkovsky/knowledge_graph_research">an experiment</a> that was provided by <a href="https://cyber.page/network/euler/hero/cybervaloper177y7sqkxmvl22j632haf8y9gv0j3weds5e4sd5">groovybear</a> while he researched the knowledge Graph for attack vectors on ranking algorithm.</p>

<p>The first 10 string CIDs, excluding the experiment, are:</p>

<p>&ldquo;class&rdquo;, &ldquo;united states&rdquo;, &ldquo;city&rdquo;, &ldquo;japan&rdquo;, &ldquo;canada&rdquo;, &ldquo;property&rdquo;, &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, &ldquo;england&rdquo;, &ldquo;list of latin words with english derivatives&rdquo;, &ldquo;united kingdom&rdquo;.</p>

<p>All the top pictures are photos from cyber Academy events.</p>

<p>There were 36 unique addresses that took a part in the discipline. The rewards distribution and the histogram are provided below:</p>

<p><img src="relevance.png" alt="relevance" /></p>

<p>The amount of users that got less than 20 GCYBs is almost equal to the amount of users that got more than 20. The 1st place was won by a landslide. It means this address holds the most particles in the top. The distribution looks like that of the power law, which seems expected.</p>

<p>The main conclusion from this discipline is that cyberlinks have to be expensive. This will lead to improving the quality of the knowledge Graph, and will defend the knowledge Graph from these types of attacks by bots and other attacks in general.</p>

<h2 id="load">Load</h2>

<p>This discipline was created to load the network with cyberlinks from different nodes for monitoring the network behavior on different loads. Due to this, we detected a <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber/issues/573">critical bug</a> during high load periods.</p>

<p>After we have discovered this bug, the continuations of the discipline carried no logic for the development of the network or the Graph. The community voted on closing this discipline on block height 3,638,501 by text <a href="https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-link-update/">proposal #28</a>.</p>

<p>For calculating rewards, a <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/blob/pre-bostrom/gol_rewards/load_rewards.py">script</a> was provided that collected all the cyberlinks from block heights 1 to 3,638,501.</p>

<p>The karma for cyberlinks was changed from 0 to 4, according to the network load. Note that values corresponding to 0 were changed to 1 by the script, because a <code>0</code> value is impossible. It was a minor bug in the network API that was fixed in the reward script.</p>

<p><img src="load.png" alt="load" /></p>

<p>There are 74 unique addresses that took part in this discipline. The result is less beautiful than before, because one address was linking like it was possessed. Some addresses tried to catch up and get a piece of the pie, but the result is what is expected. More than one-half of the reward went to the <code>crazy</code> linker :)</p>

<p>The load discipline wasn&rsquo;t bringing a lot of value to the knowledge Graph, but the value was achieved from load-testing the network IRL.</p>

<h2 id="delegation-and-lifetime">Delegation and Lifetime</h2>

<p>Those disciplines were about earning your validators&rsquo; reputation by having an efficient infrastructure and providing a constant lifetime. This worked as a promotion of your services to the early community. They are grouped in one section because they bring similar values.</p>

<p>All the calculations are based on <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberindex-euler">cyberindex-euler indexer</a>. Also, it should be noted that the <code>lifetime</code> discipline includes not just precomits from <code>euler-6</code>, but also the precomits from <code>euler-5</code>, according to the <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/blob/0.1.0/migrations/e-6%20migration_proposal.md">migration protocol</a>.</p>

<p><img src="delegation.png" alt="delegation" /></p>

<p>There were 42(!) validators that took part in the delegation discipline. 32 validators got more than 20 GCYBs, another 10 got less, because they were <code>unbonded</code> for most of the time the network run. Nice distribution, no comments.</p>

<p><img src="lifetime.png" alt="lifetime" /></p>

<p>There were 57 validators that took part in the lifetime discipline during <code>euler-5</code> and <code>euler-6</code>. 41 validators got more than 20 GCYBs.</p>

<p>The different amount of validators, in comparison with the delegation discipline, comes due to the fact that some operators changed the operator address or operators stopping to support the next version of the network.</p>

<p>Anyway, delegation and lifetime disciplines have the most beautiful distribution pictures. The cyber~Congress team appreciates all the responsible validators for that.</p>

<h2 id="community-pool">Community pool</h2>

<p>During the <code>euler</code> testnets, we expected some experiments with governance from the community. All the governance decisions of the community pool spend proposals that took part during the testnet, will be migrated to <code>bostrom</code> and <code>cyber</code> networks.</p>

<p>This discipline is responsible for partnerships between the knowledge Graph and the <a href="https://confio.tech/">Confio</a> team, the <a href="https://keplr.xyz/">Keplr</a> team, <a href="https://www.citizencosmos.space/">Citizen Cosmos</a> and the <a href="https://cosmos-cap.com/#/">Cosmos-cap</a>. Those partnerships have and will bring long term value to the future development of the Graph.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Snedashkovsky/cybergift">cyber gift research</a> that was developed by <a href="https://cyber.page/network/euler/hero/cybervaloper177y7sqkxmvl22j632haf8y9gv0j3weds5e4sd5">groovybear</a> really improved the drop mechanisms for different types of blockchain communities.</p>

<p>A lot of community members came to the <code>fuckgoogle</code> community because of the <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/foundation/tree/master/evangelism">evangelism program</a> by <a href="https://cyber.page/network/euler/hero/cybervaloper1f7nx65pmayfenpfwzwaamwas4ygmvalqwetkam">Citizen Cosmos</a> and a bit less from the bounty video program by <a href="https://cyber.page/network/euler/hero/cybervaloper1ccvpcq9ffy0qd2ca8nmmpzfamtyjfc9zhhua7q">POSTHUMAN</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment of calculating the rewards, the cyber~Congress team decided to add additional 0.01 GCYB to each address with reward less than 1 GCYB, to provide availability to link in future networks.</p>

<p><img src="comm_pool.png" alt="comm_pool" /></p>

<p>There were 207 agents that took part in the community pool discipline. The distribution is uneven, due to its nature. The addresses fall into two groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Group with the agents who brought a significant value to the project (groovybear, Ethan from Confio, Keplr team, Citizen Cosmos etc.)</li>
<li>Bounty hunters group</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="gol-holders">GOL holders</h1>

<p>Token holders accepted <a href="https://cyber.page/governance/21">a proposal</a> to allocate tokens of <code>bostrom</code> and <code>cyber</code> on 1 to 1 proportion for ERC20 GOL token holders.</p>

<p>This option will be available for claiming as soon as bridges will be developed. As a result, GOL holders can change their tokens to network tokens on 1 to 1 basis and vice-versa, if and when, tokens are available in the bridge liquidity pool.</p>

<h1 id="port">Port</h1>

<p>For the visitors of the Port, a migration protocol was prepared.</p>

<p>Port will be working with <code>pre-bostrom</code>, <code>bostrom</code>, and <code>cyber</code> networks and any port visitor will get tokens of the current network according to the port distribution rules. Port will be launched on any network, as soon as the software be able to send tokens.</p>

<p>All port visitor addresses up to ETH block height of 12,611,508 (~6,200,000 in <code>euler-6</code> network) will be pushed to the <code>pre-bostrom</code> Genesis file. As soon as the port will be opened in the new network, all the newcomers (transactions after 12,611,508 block height on ETH) will start to receive their tokens. This protocol is true in future migrations by the snapshot selected on ETH block.</p>

<p>At the current moment, more than 500 ETH were donated, which make up the project’s market cap to be 458019 ETH.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Distribution in PoS networks is a complex issue. The distribution games should always strive to be a part of future networks development. The Game of Links was the first game with such complexity to our knowledge. Not all things went as expected, but this Game is a good example of how distribution should go, according to principles and values of open source and blockchain communities, such as transparency, trustless execution, privacy, etc.</p>

<p>For the network, this Game showed possible attack vectors on the knowledge Graph, the real value of cyberlinks and previously unknown bugs. It was also a huge step to understanding in which direction the UI/UX should be built in apps functioning on top of the knowledge Graph.</p>

<p>The distribution achieved just 13.33% out of the desirable, but it was done for by a strong and a quality community. It means that there are more than 20 TCYBs distributed, which are more than 2% of the Genesis supply.</p>

<p><img src="results.png" alt="results" /></p>

<p>There were 383 addresses that took part in the Game of Links (424 if we include the takeoff discipline). Unfortunately, 30 addresses got less than 1 MCYB, but in general the distribution happened in accordance with the agent’s activity.</p>

<p>The cyber~Congress team wants to thank each hero and master that joined us on this difficult journey of building the Great Web. We&rsquo;re ready for the next steps and hope you stay with us.</p>

<p><strong>fuckgoogle!</strong></p>

      <description>Bostrom canary network is coming and cyber~Congress team want to propose the protocol for pre-bostrom and bostrom networks launching.
 Start pre-bostrom network as soon as it ready for launch. Incentivise the pre-bostrom network for validating with 50 GCYBs per month by the lifetime discipline protocol.  Rationale: The euler-6 network and the Game of Links have exhausted and the cyber~Congress team intends to move on with the brand new network.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bostrom canary network is coming and cyber~Congress team want to propose the protocol for <code>pre-bostrom</code> and <code>bostrom</code> networks launching.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start <code>pre-bostrom</code> network as soon as it ready for launch.</li>
<li>Incentivise the <code>pre-bostrom</code> network for validating with 50 GCYBs per month by the <code>lifetime</code> discipline protocol.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Rationale:</em>  The <code>euler-6</code> network and the Game of Links have exhausted and the cyber~Congress team intends to move on with the brand new network. The launch is a complex task and that why we want to test the network before the canary network launch. The best option for testing is bringing to the community the working network. We chose the way with running incentivized <code>pre-network</code> release for collecting and fixing bugs and, also, for defining the network params.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prolong the final of the Game of Links until the <code>~3 weeks</code> deadline before the launch of  <code>Bostrom</code>. This means that we&rsquo;re going to close the disciplines of the game, only with the knowledge of the launch date.</li>
<li>Change the distribution of disciplines(load, relevance, lifetime, delegation) to 500 GCYB.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Rationale:</em> As expected, the Congress team requires more time for the launch of the <code>Bostrom</code> canary network. We need a running network to keep developing cyber.page and onboard new community members.</p>

<p>We would like to include new players, that have joined Cyber over the last few months of the game.

<p>On December 30th the Game of Links final was prolonged until the 1st of March <a href="https://cyber.page/governance/19">with proposal #19</a>. The rationale behind the proposal evolved around the development of the next stage of <code>Cyber</code>, the <code>Bostrom</code> canary network. In the proposal, we have mentioned that if this won&rsquo;t be enough, the Congress team will propose a new timeframe, and here it is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prolong the final of the Game of Links until the 1st of May 2021, instead of 1st of March 2021</li>

<p><em>Rationale:</em> As expected, the Congress team requires more time for the launch of the <code>Bostrom</code> canary network. We need a running network to keep developing cyber.page and onboard new community members.

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Cyber has had a very productive and filled with events 2020. Here, at <a href="https://client.aragon.org/#/cybercongress">cyber~Congress</a> (the launching DAO behind Cyber), we have decided to put together a short review of the year.</p>

<p>Before we move on, we would like to take a minute to thank everyone who has been supporting us. Whether by helping to test the network as a validator, creating cyberlinks as a user, or helping our DAO, cyber~Congress, by participating in the <a href="https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff">takeoff donation round</a>. Taking the time to complete our silly (but useful) bounties, voting on proposals, talking in chats, following our Twitter account, or simply, if you did anything this year to #fuckgoogle!</p>

<p>We wish all of you the best holiday season and a very open-source and a productive 2021!</p>

<h2 id="cyber">Cyber?</h2>

<p>The biggest question of the year has been: <code>what is Cyber</code>? What is its purpose and where are we headed? Of course, internally, we know these answers from the inception of the protocol, but we have had difficulty sharing across our message. We have tried to pinpoint our product market fit several times over the past few years. So far, without success. Considering our previous blockchain experience, we knew this isn&rsquo;t going to be an easy ride. But we were surprised to learn how difficult it is to find a market fit for software, even in the case where this software can solve a real world issue.</p>

<p>So, what is Cyber?</p>

<p>Thanks, to one of our bounties, one of Cyber&rsquo;s users, has put together <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTrGJRM6IME">a short 45-second overview video</a>. We think that it is the best attempt at explaining Cyber so far, in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>Cyber is a decentralized computer. It is a piece of software, buggy, yet already proven to work software. It is designed to do one thing: answer questions. One might ask why? Why do I need software that answers questions? Well. That&rsquo;s a great question. We believe that there is no harm in asking questions. Asking questions is what, often, separates us as humans from other species (not just this, of course).</p>

<p>We think that answers should be free of blackbox, intermediary opinions. Answers should be free of censorship and bureaucratic hassle. Blockchain technology, cryptography and game theory provide a great deal of progress in creating a specialized piece of software that can answer questions in a decentralized manner.</p>

<p>Cyber is a software 2.0 protocol that, currently, has 2 functioning apps (just like the Ethereum protocol has apps like Uniswap). Both of those apps are open-source and can be reached at <a href="https://cyber.page/">cyber.page</a>. These are a decentralized analogue of a search engine (searching, querying and indexing content out of user-driven p2p networks, with the help of IPFS) and a decentralized analogue of social network, that works with the help of cyberlinks, and allows for military-grade security and twits with the help of web3 signers (such as a Ledger device or a web3 browser extension, such as Keplr) and without bullshit, such as (not safe by design) emails or ads.</p>

<p>Cyber&rsquo;s computer is shaped as a superintelligent organism. A computer that, in the cyberspace, would be labeled as a consensus computer, for answers. Cyber is managed by its users and token holders without any jurisdictions and CEO’s. It is structured to act as artificial intelligence, in that it can provide answers to questions from the derived information taught to it by its users, prone outdated info, etc. It learns from the collective mind, free from intermediary opinions and answers without censoring any of the answer itself.</p>

<p>With the help of cyberlinks, IPFS, Tendermint, CUDA and cryptography, Cyber can index and rank data, which removes blackbox, intermediary opinions in the formation of the semantics core of the internet. This helps to decentralize the infrastructure of the upcoming Great Web or as you may know it, web3.</p>

<p>Cyber allows to design a trustless, provable and an incentivized method of communication between those who provide content and those searching for it. Effectively removing censorship and creating a world of opportunities for such fields as, open AI, digital marketing, social networks, search mechanisms, decentralized oracles and much more.</p>

<p>Cyber is currently working on autonomous and programmable smart contracts, which will take it another step closer to becoming a superintelligence. Cyber has 2 DAO’s which help to manage it. A community pool and a programmable chain on top of the Tendermint consensus. Users can manage the chain, vote on its parameters, like inflation or the search algorithm, etc. And euler~Foundation (which will evolve into cyber~Foundation) an Aragon, ETH-based DAO, which acts as a decentralized venture fund and Ethereum embassy for Cyber. Hence, separating money (ETH) managed by the users and the state (the chain).</p>

<p>Is this the long way to explain what Cyber does? Yes, it is. But we progress. And what we can&rsquo;t explain in 45 seconds, seems that our users can.</p>

<p>As we progress into 2021, you can expect new releases, ideas, upgrades, DAO interactions, self-sustained smart contracts, new proposals, gamification, bug fixes and hopefully, a mainet. Will Cyber launch in 2021? We surely hope so. Our task is to deliver a self-sustainable, decentralized piece of working software that can solve a world renowned issue: decentralize the core of the internet, and we have no issue with coming late to the party, yet making a good entrance.</p>

<p>What did happen in Cyber over 2020? Well, quite a lot. And here are some of the main events that occurred over the course of the last year:</p>

<h3 id="2019-12-19-euler-5-and-the-game-of-links-launch-https-cybercongress-ai-euler-5-launch"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/euler-5-launch/">2019.12.19 Euler-5 and the Game of Links launch</a></h3>

<p>This is cheating, we know. But the event happened so close to 2020 that we decided to include it in the report.</p>

<p>This event marked our transition from virtually stellar mode (although we were open-source since day 0) to going into a public mode. We launched our first, large, public incentivized testnet and did it (no - not with hookers, blackjack and all of that&hellip; although I personally, can&rsquo;t promise that no immoral deeds occurred) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpoKq-fCXhM&amp;list=PLOcP3DXQoNUXmh7ob0Fm6p12L20zn0zbT&amp;index=8">live</a>!</p>

<p>The event, of course, marked the beginning of the first large distribution round, the Game of Links. The game plays a major role for the distribution of our mainet token, CYB, as it awards those who help to build the network and believe in what Cyber does from day one.</p>

<h3 id="2019-12-20-euler-5-release-episode-i-a-new-hope-https-cybercongress-ai-euler-5-release"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/euler-5-release/">2019.12.20 Euler-5 release. Episode I: a new hope</a></h3>

<p>We love timestamps, recording our work and our releases: <code>go-cyber</code> and <code>cyber.page</code></p>

<h3 id="2020-02-24-first-critical-bug-https-cybercongress-ai-euler-6-migration"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/euler-6-migration/">2020.02.24 first critical bug</a></h3>

<p>One of the main challenges of a testnet is bug hunting. And we found one of them with the help of our community. It was an awesome experience, we developed a migration protocol and fixed bugs to move on with minimum delay.</p>

<h3 id="2020-04-04-euler-6-launch">2020.04.04 Euler-6 launch</h3>

<p>Just a little after, we&rsquo;ve done all the preparations to restart the network. Also, we&rsquo;ve tested the genesis ceremony and the launch process as it should be in the mainnet.</p>

<h3 id="2020-04-15-euler-foundation-aragon-ceremony-https-cybercongress-ai-euler-ceremony"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/euler-ceremony/">2020.04.15 euler~Foundation Aragon ceremony</a></h3>

<p>The cyber~Congress DAO launched <a href="https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation">euler~Foundation</a> to Aragons mainet and released the euler~Foundation Aragon ceremony <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation/blob/master/euler-foundation/foundation.md">setup guide</a>. This was an epic event for Cyber and the DAO space! euler~Foundation is a DAO, launched by another DAO, for the community that will govern a self-sustainable protocol, Cyber.</p>

<h3 id="2020-04-17-the-test-auction-and-cross-chain-mechanics-https-cybercongress-ai-how-to-get-eul-tokens-if-you-have-none"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/how-to-get-eul-tokens-if-you-have-none/">2020.04.17 the test auction and cross chain mechanics</a></h3>

<p>In April, to test euler~Foundation we launched a cross chain bridge between ETH and our Cosmos-SDK chain, with the help of which users could participate in an ERC-20 token auction, vest these tokens and then redeem 1-1 tokens on the Euler chain.</p>

<h3 id="2020-04-25-takeoff-proposal-https-cyber-page-governance-2"><a href="https://cyber.page/governance/2">2020.04.25 takeoff proposal</a></h3>

<p>The first proposal to start the takeoff donation round. And we started it as soon as it was approved. We are really proud that all the decisions we make, are done together with the network and the community, with the help of on-chain governance.</p>

<h3 id="2020-04-26-evangelism-https-cybercongress-ai-post-obep"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/post/obep/">2020.04.26 evangelism</a></h3>

<p>As part of our takeoff and in the spirit of Cyber, we launched our evangelism program. Our canary ETH-based DAO, euler~Foundation enlightened and blessed those who applied, via web3 apps, to spread the gospel of Cyber. There were just under a dozen applicants, which received a small, yet a hefty bug of tokens for the fulfilled tasks, such as managing TG groups, Discord servers, helping with the donations, etc.</p>

<h3 id="2020-05-10-upgrade-takeoff-https-cyber-page-governance-5"><a href="https://cyber.page/governance/5">2020.05.10 upgrade takeoff</a></h3>

<p>The takeoff round didn&rsquo;t go as expected and was so far from what we expected that we decided to upgrade the takeoff round by simplifying the distribution curve and decreasing the desirable amount of ATOMs. We, in the sentence above, once again means the community. On-chain proposal - again.</p>

<h3 id="2020-05-21-proposal-to-cosmos-https-www-mintscan-io-cosmos-proposals-26"><a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/26">2020.05.21 proposal to cosmos</a></h3>

<p>One of my favorite times of 2020. Yes, I am biased. This was the first attempt at decentralized venture capital across the blockchain space, a little before the DeFi craze actually occurred.</p>

<p>As a DAO, we proposed to sell part of our mainet tokens to the Cosmos hub (in an exchange for some ATOM tokens and the future IBC) and created an onchain governance proposal for this. It was crazy, the first public Cosmos-SDK chain AMA on Cosmos TG, a fortnight of Q&amp;A, and&hellip; and, alas, the proposal didn&rsquo;t go thorough. I don&rsquo;t think this is the right place to call for judgments, so I won&rsquo;t. But we are glad that we did this and many lessons were learned, hopefully not just by us, but by everyone. And, yes, you may (almost defiantly) expect Cyber to repeat this attempt in 2021.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-22-onchain-upgrade-darwin-https-cybercongress-ai-darwin-upgrade"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/darwin-upgrade/">2020.07.22 onchain upgrade Darwin</a></h3>

<p>The most brilliant technical trick in the network. A new bug was found, and it was necessary to upgrade all the nodes, so that they continue to validate the network. Thanks to the upgrade module introduced by the Regen Network team (which was tested in a series of Regen Network testnets and then merged into one of the latest Cosmos-SDK releases), we had the option for repairing and adding features without the necessity to restart the network from genesis. And we made it! <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> validators support and some lost nerves, and as a result: <code>Cyber</code> the first network after Regen to use an on-chain upgrade. It was awesome.</p>

<h3 id="2020-09-23-the-first-network-halt">2020.09.23 the first network halt</h3>

<p>One never knows where the next bug is and how critical it will be. Our team was getting ready for our traditional trip to the mountains, and 1 day before, the network halt occurred. Later we came to the conclusion that it will be our biggest problem of 2020. A memory leak and network fragmentation. Together with the team and our validators, we resurrected the network from the halted block. Our small victory.</p>

<h3 id="2020-10-04-bounty-1-https-ai-cybercongress-ai-t-prop-10-description-discussion-tasks-rewards-110-and-2020-11-19-bounty-2-https-ai-cybercongress-ai-t-prop-16-discussion-and-rewards-149"><a href="https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/prop-10-description-discussion-tasks-rewards/110">2020.10.04 bounty 1</a> and <a href="https://ai.cybercongress.ai/t/prop-16-discussion-and-rewards/149">2020.11.19 bounty 2</a></h3>

<p>Once again, we, the community, following an onchain governance proposals, used the community pool to launch 2 social bounty programs. Both cases were successful and attracted around 200 unique users with over 80 becoming active users.</p>

<p>Further, we started to develop <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation/blob/master/cyberfundclassic/bounty.md">an amazing onchain, automatic bounty program</a>, which in due time, just might be developed into a separate Cyber-SDK module.</p>

<h3 id="2020-10-07-prolong-takeoff-proposal-https-cybercongress-ai-takeoff-prolong"><a href="https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-prolong/">2020.10.07 prolong takeoff proposal</a></h3>

<p>Despite the previous upgrade, the takeoff round did not meet the desired expectations. We asked the community to prolong it till December 1st to finish the round on a beautiful date.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>December 3rd saw an <a href="https://cyber.page/network/euler/tx/21E2702B7A2A9754CA3770EB69D3740513A6C3C3D9F71F922E37C25CB6F0DB57">outgoing transaction</a> from the cyber~Congress multisig account to over 56 addresses, that participated in the first step of <a href="https://cybercongress.ai/takeoff-results">the takeoff donation round</a>. According to the rules of the Game of Links, after the distribution, the final of the game should have kicked off, and was meant to last for 21 days.
We feel that there hasn&rsquo;t been enough time to unlock the potential of the Game and propose to prolong the game:</p>

<h2 id="prolonging-the-final">Prolonging the final</h2>

<p>The final of the Game of Links will lasts, at least, till March 1st, 2021 00:00:00 UTC instead of December 25th, 2020, 00:00:00 UTC.</p>

<p><em>Rationale:</em> The next stage of development for Cyber is the <code>Bostrom</code> canary network. We believe that we should prolong the support for the current network, till at least, March 1st. If this won&rsquo;t be enough time, we will propose one more prolongation, with updated distribution params in the future. We want to include all the new players that have joined Cyber over the last few months in the game. Organic distribution is the success key for the growth of a blockchain project and we don&rsquo;t want to miss all of our future masters and heroes.</p>

<h2 id="increase-rewards">Increase rewards</h2>

<p>Discipline rewards will be increased to 2 TCYB. We prefer round numbers and propose the following values:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Discipline</th>
<th align="right">GCYB</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>relevance</td>
<td align="right">1100</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>load</td>
<td align="right">500</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>delegation</td>
<td align="right">250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>lifetime</td>
<td align="right">150</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>total</td>
<td align="right">2000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Rationale:</em> we expect more users and players this winter as a result of our actions. Since we want to increase the time of the final, it&rsquo;s obvious, that we also need to increase rewards.</p>

<h2 id="uniform-the-full-validators-set-discipline">Uniform the full validators set discipline</h2>

<p><em>Rationale:</em> it is obvious, that it is virtually impossible to accomplish the discipline with the current conditions. A solution is to calibrate the discipline.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>Heroes</th>

<li><code>56</code> Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and won <code>~12,1</code> TCYB out of <code>100</code> TCYB</li>
<li>The rewards for disciplines that were dependent on the takeoff results are <code>~1.9</code> TCYB out of <code>38</code> TCYB</li>
<li><code>56</code> Cosmos addresses participated in the takeoff and will share the bonus of  <code>~100</code> TEUL out of <code>~240</code> TEUL for the final of the Game of Links</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to your contributions the cyber~Congress DAO was able to function since Apr 2020. After payouts to evangelists and team members, we will be able to sustain the DAO until Mar 2021. Of course, that is not what we dreamt of, but its definitely more than zero. During the takeoff, about half of the sum, was donated by DAO members and their friends. The other half was donated by our awesome community. To us, this is proof that we are heading in the right direction. May the force be with you.</p>

<h2 id="eul-tokens">EUL tokens</h2>

<p>According to Cybers <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf">whitepaper</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to CYB tokens, Game of Links allocates test EUL tokens to all Takeoff donors for the final</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means an extra bonus for donors, paid out in EUL tokens proportionally per the donated ATOMs. EUL tokens are distributed from the cyber~Congress <a href="https://cyber.page/network/euler/contract/cyber1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqvdq39v8">multisig address</a> in <code>euler-6</code> network. Check your balances.</p>

<p>The second transaction is the cashback bonus for evangelists. The teams incentives, outlined in our <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md">documents</a>, will also be included in that transaction.</p>

<h2 id="cyb-tokens">CYB tokens</h2>

<p>Some discipline rewards were dependent on the takeoff results:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Discipline</th>
<th align="right">~ GCYB</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>relevance</td>
<td align="right">1006</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>load</td>
<td align="right">503</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>delegation</td>
<td align="right">251</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>lifetime</td>
<td align="right">151</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>total</td>
<td align="right">1911</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The result of two disciplines, the full validator set and the community pool, will remain unknown until the end of the <a href="https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/">Game of Links</a>.</p>

<p>According to paragraph 17 of the Game of Links and Cybers <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/cyber.pdf">whitepaper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All CYB tokens that remain from the Takeoff, are allocated to the community pool at the end of the game. All CYB tokens that remain from the disciplines are allocated to cyber~Congress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The closing price of the round is <code>1.485</code> ATOM/GCYB. This means that we&rsquo;re closing the takeoff donation round with a market cap of <code>~1,485,000</code> ATOMs or ~ <code>13,384</code> ETH. The price of the GCYB at the end of takeoff is <code>0.013385</code> ETH.</p>

<p>Distribution of a PoS-like blockchain is pretty complex. Currently, we have distributed 27.21% of the genesis supply.</p>

<p><img src="distribution.png" alt="distribution" /></p>

<p>Our key findings from the takeoff, is that public funding are not optimal for initial distribution. We are going to significantly update the distribution rules and propose them to the chain governance.</p>

<h2 id="the-final">The final</h2>

<p>According to the rules of the Game of Links, the final of the game should start after the end of the takeoff and last for a period of 21 days. But we feel that it needs more time. Soon, we will publish a governance proposal for updating provisions and further details.</p>

<p>At the time of the final, you should play at your best if you want to get your hands on more distribution of the future mainnet, aka more CYB tokens. Distributed EUL tokens will help you to achieve your goals and will probably play a significant role in the results of the Game.</p>

<p>Good luck Heroes and Masters of the Great Web! Code speed.</p>

      <description>These are the last days of Cybers takeoff round and this is a good time to draw some initial conclusions.
We&amp;rsquo;ve started the takeoff donation round on 30 of March 2020, we then updated the rules of the round on the 27 of April 2020, following a governance proposal.
Our aim was to distribute 100 TEULs and 100 TCYBs to ATOM donors. 100 TCYBs will be distributed to donors proportionally per their donated ATOMs and the order of the transactions.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the last days of Cybers <a href="https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff">takeoff round</a> and this is a good time to draw some initial conclusions.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve started the takeoff donation round on 30 of March 2020, we then updated the rules of the round on the 27 of April 2020, following a governance proposal.</p>

<p>Our aim was to distribute 100 TEULs and 100 TCYBs to ATOM donors. 100 TCYBs will be distributed to donors proportionally per their donated ATOMs and the order of the transactions. The function of the token distribution is:</p>

<pre><code>f(x) = 40 * x + 1000
where f(x) - TCYB price in ATOMs, and x is the amount of TCYBs won
</code></pre>

<p>Regardless of the donated amount, 100 TEULs will be distributed to all takeoff donors at the end of the round,  proportionally per the ATOM they have donated. These EULS are to be used during the 21-day final of the <a href="https://cyber.page/gol">Game of Links</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the exiting results of the takeoff:</p>

<ul>
<li>47 Cosmos addresses participated</li>
<li>12699.81558 ATOM was donated during the takeoff period (4.23% of the originally desired amount)</li>
<li>~10500 GCYB are ready for distribution to those 47 addresses</li>
<li>the latest ATOM/GCYB price is 1.419 (1 billion CYB = 1.419 ATOM)</li>
<li>the current market cap of CYB is 1,419,093 ATOMs or  7,734,056 $ at 5.45 USD/ATOM</li>
<li>8 evangelists brought newcomers to Cyber and will share a reward of ~750 ATOMs and an additional CYB reward</li>
</ul>

<p>On 01 of December 2020 members of the  cyber~Congress DAO will run <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit/tree/0.1.0/takeoff_distribution">this script</a> to prepare transactions for the first step of the distribution and will make 2 multisig transactions in Cosmos and Cyber networks. The script will execute:</p>

<ul>
<li>EULs distribution to takeoff donors</li>
<li>Distribution of the <a href="https://cyber.page/evangelism">evangelism program</a> reward in ATOMs</li>
<li>Distribution of ATOM reward to the DAO <a href="https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/teams/incentives.md">team distribution</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The last call for the takeoff: you are still able to take part in building the Great Web :)</p>

      <description>Surely, most of you have paid attention to our previous announcements that the donation takeoff round was prolonged. The decision was pushed by a governance proposal to finish it off with a beautiful date and give the cyber~Congress DAO a bit of extra time to design the next allocation round. This means that the Game of Links will finish exactly a year after it begun. A year is a long enough time to come to conclusions about the Game itself and the community, and finalize the next development vectors.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Surely, most of you have paid attention to our previous announcements that the <a href="https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff">donation takeoff round</a> was prolonged. The decision was pushed by <a href="https://cyber.page/governance/11">a governance proposal</a> to finish it off with a beautiful date and give the <a href="https://client.aragon.org/#/cybercongress/">cyber~Congress DAO</a> a bit of extra time to design the next allocation round. This means that the <a href="https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/">Game of Links</a> will finish exactly a year after it begun. A year is a long enough time to come to conclusions about the Game itself and the community, and finalize the next development vectors.</p>

<p>The takeoff donation round will finish on Dec 1, 2020, 00.00.00 UTC. This means that the Game of Links will go into its final round for another 21 days, and then, will cease to exist in its current form. The final round of the Game of Links is the time when we will unleash EUL tokens to donors. This will allow making crazy things with a much higher concentration of stake (in the hands of those who played over the past year) and make significant influence on the outcome of the Game.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/">the Game of Links guidelines</a> we will be distributing EUL tokens to donors after the end of the takeoff, and then, 21+ days later, we&rsquo;ll publish the results of the Game of Links. Those results will be included in the mainnet.</p>

<p>Stay safe and play the Game of Links 🙂</p>
